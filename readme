ðŸ“Œ My First MySQL Project

This project contains my very first MySQL script where I practiced creating a database, defining a table, inserting records, and retrieving data using SQL queries.

ðŸ”¹ Features Covered 

1-Database Creation

  Removes the database if it already exists.

  Creates a new database named college1.

2-Table Creation

  A table named emp is created with the following columns:

  id INT PRIMARY KEY â†’ A unique number for each record.

--> Primary Key means:

  Every row must have a unique value for this column.

  It cannot be NULL.

  It helps uniquely identify each record.

name VARCHAR(50) â†’ The employeeâ€™s name.

--> VARCHAR means "Variable Length Character String".

It can store text up to 50 characters, but only uses storage for the actual number of characters entered.

marks INT â†’ Stores marks (numbers).

grade VARCHAR(1) â†’ Stores the grade as a single character like A, B, C.

city VARCHAR(20) â†’ Stores the city name (up to 20 characters).

3- Insert Records

  Added sample employee records into the emp table.

4- Data Retrieval

Used SELECT * FROM emp; to display all employee records.
